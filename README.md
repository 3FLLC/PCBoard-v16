It's October 2019, and I am in the process of wrapping up the Initial Pre-Alpha Build. We have 3 sets of ANSI files in this release, thanks to our Alpha members George, Lawrence and Myself. George and I are in the process of porting everything to multilingual. (English, and Dutch are first, then others will follow as users step-up).
